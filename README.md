# Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction
## Project Report

## Executive Summary

Missed healthcare appointments (no-shows) represent a significant challenge for healthcare providers, resulting in revenue loss, decreased operational efficiency, and potentially compromised patient care. This project developed a machine learning model to predict appointment no-shows, enabling healthcare facilities to implement targeted interventions and optimize scheduling practices. The model achieved approximately 78% accuracy in predicting no-shows and identified key factors influencing patient attendance behavior.

Key findings include:
- SMS reminders significantly reduce no-show rates
- Appointment lead time strongly influences attendance probability
- Certain days of the week have consistently higher no-show rates
- Demographic factors and health conditions correlate with attendance patterns

Based on these insights, we recommend implementing a multi-faceted approach including strategic overbooking, automated reminder systems, optimized scheduling windows, and targeted interventions for high-risk patients.

## Business Context

Healthcare facilities face significant operational challenges when patients fail to attend scheduled appointments. These no-shows result in:

- **Revenue Loss**: Unutilized appointment slots represent direct revenue loss
- **Resource Underutilization**: Staff and equipment remain idle during no-show periods
- **Extended Wait Times**: New patients face longer wait times for appointments
- **Care Continuity Issues**: Patients who miss appointments may experience delays in necessary treatment

By accurately predicting which patients are likely to miss appointments, healthcare providers can implement targeted interventions to reduce no-show rates and optimize scheduling practices.

## Data Overview

The analysis utilized a dataset containing the following key features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| PatientID | Unique identifier for each patient |
| Age | Patient's age |
| Gender | Patient's gender (M/F) |
| ScheduledDay | Date when the appointment was scheduled |
| AppointmentDay | Date of the actual appointment |
| SMS_received | Whether the patient received an SMS reminder (1=Yes, 0=No) |
| Neighbourhood | Patient's residential area |
| Hypertension | Whether the patient has hypertension (1=Yes, 0=No) |
| Diabetes | Whether the patient has diabetes (1=Yes, 0=No) |
| Alcoholism | Whether the patient has alcoholism (1=Yes, 0=No) |
| Handicap | Level of handicap (0-4) |
| No-show | Whether the patient missed the appointment (Yes/No) |

Additionally, the following engineered features were created during preprocessing:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| LeadTime | Days between scheduling and appointment date |
| AppointmentDayOfWeek | Day of the week for the appointment |
| AgeGroup | Categorized age ranges |
| LeadTimeGroup | Categorized lead time ranges |

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase included the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Converting date columns to datetime format
   - Handling missing values using median imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical features
   - Removing any remaining rows with missing values

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculating lead time between scheduling and appointment dates
   - Extracting day of week from appointment date
   - Creating age groups and lead time groups for analysis
   - Converting the target variable to binary format (0=Show, 1=No-show)

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis revealed several important patterns:

1. **Age Distribution**: Younger patients showed higher no-show rates compared to older patients

2. **Lead Time Impact**: Longer lead times (days between scheduling and appointment) correlated with higher no-show rates

3. **Day of Week Patterns**: Certain days of the week consistently showed higher no-show rates

4. **SMS Effectiveness**: Patients who received SMS reminders were more likely to attend their appointments

5. **Health Conditions**: Patients with certain health conditions showed different attendance patterns

### Model Development

The predictive model was developed using the following approach:

1. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features were selected based on exploratory analysis and domain knowledge

2. **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% testing sets

3. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: A preprocessing pipeline was created to handle:
   - Standardization of numerical features
   - One-hot encoding of categorical features

4. **Model Training**: A Decision Tree classifier was trained on the preprocessed data

5. **Model Evaluation**: The model was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## Key Findings

### No-Show Patterns

The analysis revealed several significant patterns in appointment no-shows:

1. **Day of Week Impact**:
   - Highest no-show rates occurred on specific days of the week
   - Weekends generally showed higher no-show rates than weekdays

2. **Lead Time Correlation**:
   - Appointments scheduled 0-7 days in advance had the lowest no-show rates
   - No-show probability increased significantly for appointments scheduled more than 30 days in advance

3. **Demographic Factors**:
   - Younger patients (19-35 age group) had higher no-show rates
   - No-show rates varied significantly by neighborhood

4. **SMS Reminder Effectiveness**:
   - Patients who received SMS reminders showed substantially lower no-show rates
   - The difference in no-show rates between patients with and without SMS reminders was statistically significant

### Model Performance

The Decision Tree classifier achieved the following performance metrics:

- **Accuracy**: ~78% (correctly predicted both shows and no-shows)
- **Precision**: ~75% (proportion of correctly predicted no-shows among all predicted no-shows)
- **Recall**: ~70% (proportion of actual no-shows that were correctly predicted)

The confusion matrix provided a detailed breakdown of prediction results:

- True Negatives: Correctly predicted shows
- False Positives: Incorrectly predicted no-shows (patients actually attended)
- False Negatives: Incorrectly predicted shows (patients actually missed appointments)
- True Positives: Correctly predicted no-shows

### Feature Importance

The model identified the following features as most predictive of no-shows (in order of importance):

1. **Lead Time**: Longer lead times increased no-show probability
2. **SMS_received**: Receiving SMS reminders decreased no-show probability
3. **Age**: Younger patients were more likely to miss appointments
4. **AppointmentDayOfWeek**: Certain days showed higher no-show rates
5. **Neighbourhood**: Residential area influenced attendance patterns

## Optimization Recommendations

Based on the analysis and model results, we recommend the following strategies to reduce no-show rates and optimize scheduling:

### 1. Schedule Optimization

- **Strategic Overbooking**: Implement targeted overbooking on high-risk days
  - Overbook by approximately 15-20% on days with historically high no-show rates
  - Maintain standard scheduling on low-risk days

- **Time Slot Allocation**: Allocate high-demand time slots to patients with low no-show risk
  - Reserve early morning and late afternoon slots for patients with good attendance history
  - Schedule patients with higher no-show risk during less busy periods

### 2. Patient Communication

- **Enhanced Reminder System**: Implement a multi-channel reminder system
  - Send automated SMS reminders to all patients
  - Schedule reminders at optimal intervals (3 days before and 1 day before appointment)
  - Implement email reminders as a secondary channel

- **Confirmation Requirements**: Request appointment confirmations
  - Implement a simple response system for patients to confirm attendance
  - Follow up with phone calls for high-risk patients who don't confirm

### 3. Appointment Lead Time Management

- **Optimal Scheduling Windows**: Schedule appointments within optimal lead time windows
  - Aim for 0-7 day lead times when possible (lowest no-show rate)
  - For appointments requiring longer lead times, implement enhanced reminder protocols

- **Wait List Management**: Maintain an active wait list for short-notice appointments
  - Fill canceled slots with wait-listed patients
  - Prioritize patients with urgent needs and good attendance history

### 4. Targeted Interventions

- **Risk-Based Approach**: Use the prediction model to identify high-risk patients
  - Calculate no-show probability for each scheduled appointment
  - Implement tiered interventions based on risk level

- **High-Risk Patient Management**: Provide additional support for high-risk patients
  - Conduct phone call confirmations for patients with >50% no-show probability
  - Offer transportation assistance or telehealth options when appropriate
  - Consider incentive programs for consistent attendance

## Implementation Roadmap

We recommend implementing these optimization strategies in phases:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Communication (1-2 months)
